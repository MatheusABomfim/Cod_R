# Projects and Studies - Matheus Azevedo Bomfim

Welcome to the repository that includes analyses, projects, and studies developed based on R. This space is organized into different folders, each with a specific purpose outlined below:

---

## ðŸ“‚ **AnÃ¡lises 2024-2025 LIPa**
This folder contains the analyses carried out during 2024 and 2025 as part of my master's program. It includes:
- Studies related to my main project (Application of Machine Learning models to prognosis Patients Living with HTLV).
- Analyses conducted during the supervision process of the undergraduate student Nicholas from LIPa (Laboratory of Immunobiologicals and Immunopathology), from University of Pernambuco (UPE).
- For those interested in developing allele frequency studies, I recommend exploring the codes in the directory: â€˜Analyses 2024-2025 LIPa/ENTPD1_HTLV_Mestrado/codes/Codes_OKâ€™.
Where I cleaned up the codes and annotated them accordingly, it is worth emphasising that I used the codes iteratively to facilitate the process of re-using the code.

## ðŸ“‚ **Studies**
